How to start the backend application?

1. Go to the backend folder by typing cd backend after the initial path.
2. You need to have Node.js and npm installed in your computer.
3. Install Dependencies: in the backend folder, run 'npm install'.
4. In a TypeScript project, you need to compile it to JavaScript before running. So in the backend folder type 'tsc', it will build your project and create or update the dist folder.
5. After building it you run the server by typing 'npm start' in the backend directory.
6. You can test the endpoints after you run the server. It is in the specific port 'http://localhost:5000/contacts'
7. If any problem arises refer to the console messages and the package.json file and tsconfig.ts.

How start the frontend application?

1. Go to the frontend folder by typing cd frontend after the initial path.
2. You need to have Node.js and npm installed in your computer.
3. Install Dependencies: in the frontend folder run, 'npm install'.
4. Start the development server by using the command 'npm start'. The project will start on http://localhost:3000
5. After starting both the backend and the frontend projects in different terminals (I sugest the backend to go first), you will be able to see the data from the backend being consumed by the frontend.
6. If any problem arises refer to the console messages and the package.json file and tsconfig.ts.
